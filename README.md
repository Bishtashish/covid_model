## Project Introduction

COVID-19 has governments around the world operating in a context of radical uncertainty, and faced with difficult trade-offs given the health, economic and social challenges raised by the crisis. In less than three months at the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 crisis developed into a global pandemic. Schools and universities were closed in Spring, 2020 for more than one billion students of all ages. By June 2020, the virus spread to almost all countries and affected more than eight million people around the world. More than half of the world’s population has experienced a lockdown with strong containment measures – the first time in history that such measures have been applied on such a large scale.

Beyond the health and human tragedy of the coronavirus, it is now widely recognised that the pandemic triggered the most serious economic crisis in a century. All economic sectors are affected by disrupted global supply chains, weaker demand for imported goods and services, a drop in international tourism, or a decline in business travel, and most often a combination of these. Measures to contain the virus’ spread have hit SMEs and entrepreneurs particularly hard. Unemployment levels and the number of aid seekers have increased, sometimes dramatically. Many countries are now “exiting” virus containment measures, and moving to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis. With no treatment, vaccine or cure yet available (as of November 2020), many governments are adopting prudent strategies to limit the risk of second wave.

## Research Question

To study and predict the transmission rate across diffrent factors including various community locations, types of businesses, types of events, geographical areas and its variations.

## Approach (how you plan to address the research question):
     
      CRISP-DM //Cross-industry standard process for data mining 

      Imputation/Replace with mean, random
     
      Data understanding and EDA
     
      Balancing of Data

      Date Preparation
      
      Data Visualization
      
      Observations

      Machine Learning (if applicable - supervised, unsupervised) //stretch goal

      Evaluation
     
               
## Known Issues (problems with predictors, reporting, bias, etc.) - this will develop over time

     Lack of data standardization
     
     Bias in identification before proper testing

## Project Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak is a sharp reminder that pandemics can change the course of mankind and will continue to do so. Even if we cannot prevent dangerous viruses from emerging, we should be prepared to dampen their effects on society. The current outbreak has consequences not only on on the economy but overall on the society. In less than three months at the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 crisis developed into a global pandemic. Schools and universities were closed in Spring'20 for more than one billion students of all ages. By June 2020, the virus spread to almost all countries and affected more than eight million people around the world. More than half of the world’s population has experienced a lockdown with strong containment measures – the first time in history that such measures have been applied on such a large scale.

The sectors that have seen the largest increases in unemployment are those that are hedonic in nature and require the physical presence of the customer (e.g., hospitality, tourism, construction and stores), as demand for these services has ceased to exist. Past experience indicates that once someone is outside the job market, it is very difficult to get back on their feet. So we decided to measure most impacted people in different sectors like business, public-private sector employment, education and health. We want to visualize the impacts on different sectors so that it will help people to prepare for their future job security, to accept beneficial changes taking place during this pandemic.


## Research Question

How COVID-19 has impacted different sectors such as business, education and health.

## Approach (how you plan to address the research question):

We plan to do Exploratory data analysis of datasets which gives information about impacts of COVID-19 on different sectors. For that we are going to use the CRISP-DM approach.The CRoss-Industry Standard Process for data mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model with six phases that naturally describes the data science life cycle. It’s like a set of guardrails to help you plan, organize, and implement your data science project. Currently we are planning to focus first two phases Business understanding and Data understanding. This will help us to measure the impacts.

Business understanding – What does the business need?
	To get an idea about COVID impacts we studied many COVID related articles and papers.
Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
	For data understanding we are planning to do Exploratory Data Analysis and Data visualization.
	We will focus on below measures:
    Amount- Number of rows/columns
    Data Types- Integers/Floats/Strings/Booleans/DateTime
    Data Concept- Numerical(Continuous or Discrete)or Categorical value
    Missing Data- Drop or Fill
    Distribution- Range and Skew
    Correlation- Target and Collinearity
    Visualization- Generally Helpful Aid, Histograms and Scatterplots

Finally with the help of visualizations, we will provide our observations.

## Known Issues (problems with predictors, reporting, bias, etc.) - this will develop over time

Most important known issue is finding appropriate data as COVID has vast imapact scope.
Lack of data standardization is also an issue. Huge data is available but not in standard form. 
Bias in identification before proper testing

## Conclusion
Many pandemics have occured in the past and can even occur in the future as well, so being prepared for such pandemics is always good. The analysis of impact will help people to be prepared in case of employment, education or healthcare.

## Project Introduction

COVID-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread by people who do not know they have the disease, risk of transmission within a community can be difficult to determine. Individuals need to follow healthy hygiene practices, stay at home when sick, practice physical distancing to lower the risk of disease spread, and use a cloth face covering (with some exceptions) in community settings when physical distancing cannot be maintained. These universal precautions are appropriate regardless of the extent of mitigation needed.

The impact of Covid-19 in business outcomes and expectations: Due to Covid-19 a large number of mass-layoffs were done where more than 5800 small businesses were affected.  In the big picture, there are industries like Airlines, Leisure Facilities, Restaurants, Auto Parts and Equipment industries etc that  are most impacted by Covid-19. Weâ€™ll be analysing how the sectors that are most impacted by this pandemic are dealing with this situation, the risk of transmission, and what measures are being currently taken by them in order to handle the situation.






## Research Question

To study and predict the transmission rate across diffrent factors including various community locations, types of businesses, types of events, geographical areas and its variations.

# Predict low versus high transmission rate - How do various community locations, types of businesses, and types of events vary in terms of COVID-19 transmission risk?
